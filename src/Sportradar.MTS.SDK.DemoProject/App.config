    Optional attributes:
    vhost: The name of the virtual host configured on the AMQP broker. If the value is not specified the value of ‘/username’ attribute is used as virtual host.
    useSsl: The value specifying whether SSL will be used when connecting to the broker. Default value is true.
    node: This value is used to filter MTS responses which were produced as responses to requests send by different SDK instances. In most configurations each SDK should use different node value. Default value is 1.
    bookmakerId: When provided, it is used as the default value for the BookmakerId on the ticket. The value can be overridden when building the ticket. Betradar provides this value.
    limitId: When provided, it is used as the default value for the SelectionBuilder LimitId property on the ticket. The value can be overridden when building the ticket. Betradar provides
    the set of available values.
    currency: When provided, it is used as the default value for the Currency property on the ticket. The value must comply with the ISO 4217 standard.
    channel: When provided, it is used as the default value for the SenderChannel property on the ticket. Value must be one of the SenderChannel enumeration members.

Only used when building selection using UnifiedOdds ids. If this is set to true and the user uses UOF markets, when there are special cases (market 215, or $score in SOV/SBV template), sdk automatically tries to add appropriate specifier; if set to false, user will need to add this manually.
